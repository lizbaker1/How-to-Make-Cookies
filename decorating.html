    <h1> How to Make the Icing
    <p> You will need 3 cups of powdered sugar, 1/3 cup of butter, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of milk. In a medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and butter with spoon or electric mixer on low speed. Stir in vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the milk. Gradually beat in just enough remaining milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable. If your frosting is too think, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time. If frosting becomes too thin, beat in a small amount of powdered sugar. Frosts 13x9-inch cake generously, or fills and frosts an 8- or 9-inch two-layer cake.
